        Hi there, my name is Mugisha and I have recently completed my shecodes
        react front-end web development course. This marks the beginning of an
        intentional career in tech as a front end web developer. I am currently
        very scared and confused but this is my first project and I intend to
        build hundreds of projects as time goes. They say a journney of a
        thousand miles starts with a single step and here we are. Today was a
        very long day as lights went out and I hadn't charged my phone, but
        better late than never. here I am working on a simple project to refresh
        my mind and keep my github contributions looking green.
